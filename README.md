## Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Step 4: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create or edit the `.env` file in the project root directory.

Add the following API keys:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key
```

### API Keys Required

- **GROQ_API_KEY** – Used for accessing the Groq Large Language Model (LLM) to perform resume analysis, job description parsing, gap analysis, and resume generation.

- **FIRECRAWL_API_KEY** – Used to scrape and extract structured content from job description URLs when required by the application.

---

# Running the Application

Open the integrated terminal in **Visual Studio Code** and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app1.py
```

After running the command, Streamlit will automatically start the web application.

You will see output similar to:
